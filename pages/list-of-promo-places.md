# List of places where promotion for dev jobs happens

Most developers learn the trade in order to get a job. Thus, many learning platforms have job posts. Programming is very popular and there are learning platforms on all major social media.

This includes Discord, Telegram, Reddit, and also Facebook and others (even classifieds such as Craigslist have dev job ads)

While you will find many job posts, most will be bad or inadequate. Jobs should be within the [[Acceptable-job-specifications]].
