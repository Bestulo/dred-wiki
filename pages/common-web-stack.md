## Dred's most common web development stack

While I can use many things, the most efficient way I've found is by using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) (a React framework for production sites) with Typescript (best for team collab and projects bigger than 300 lines), styled with TailwindCSS (ideal for components and ultra fast coding), hosted on Vercel (the Vercel company also made Nextjs, so it's the most compatible web host for this framework; it is also fast, free and easy to use)
