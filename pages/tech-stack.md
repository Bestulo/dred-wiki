# Dred's tech stack

I'm a Full-Stack Developer, which means that I can do both [front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) and [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend). In terms of front-end, I'm pretty good & fast at grabbing a design and translating it into code. In terms of backend, I can make web servers, databases, form handlers, bots and more.

I cannot hope to ever list all the libraries I am familiar with or could handle with ease, but I will try to write down the main things I can use.

## Common stack!

If you're just looking for what I normally use, here's my [[common-web-stack]].

## Front-end

My front-end stack is varied because I have explored many libraries for quite some time. I have been making websites since I was 14 (15 years ago), have read CSS books and have traversed the evolution of front-end development, from when divs were "floated", through flexbox and to CSS grids.

### Styling

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [LESS](https://lesscss.org/) (not as familiar as with SASS, but it's pretty simple)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Structure & Templating

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) (previously Jade)
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/)
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (+ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/))
- [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) (+ [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/))

## Backend

All of my backend stack is Nodejs based. It's the runtime I've learned since 2016, and the only one I'm fully confident in. I can defend myself with Python and PHP, but it is to a negligible level. I have also learned some basic Elixir, Rust and Go. I am also very familiar with Deno and have deployed a few services in it.

I use Typescript for 99% of my projects. Type safety is an excellent thing to have where there are multiple collaborators handling the same pot. Despite the learning [overhead](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)>), it has allowed me to massively increase my productivity and reduced my debugging time to nearly zero.

### Servers

- Express
- Nextjs
- Koa (Oak in deno)

### Databases

- MySQL
- MongoDB
- SQLite3

### ORMs

- TypeORM (for Mongo and SQL)
- Prisma (for SQL)
- Mongoose (for Mongo)

## OS's and Distros

- Ubuntu on WSL and WSL2
- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Puppy Linux
- Linux Mint
- Debian

## Languages I speak

- English (C2)
- Spanish (C2)
- Esperanto (C1)
- French (B2)
