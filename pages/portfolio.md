## Bots I've built:

I have three bots with thousands of users, and I have dozens of minor single-use bots that have fulfilled their purpose or are only used by myself.

### Nogubot

This is my main bot where I add new functionality whenever necessary. It has thousands of lines of code and is active in around 300 monthly groups, being used by over 5k people every month.

### Capybot

It is a Discord bot made for [Capybara Exchange](https://capybaraexchange.com), a popular crypto swap in Venezuela with hundreds of monthly users. The bot has not been updated for over two years, but it has been running flawlessly since it was published, and is used by dozens of users every day to check available liquidity and token prices.
